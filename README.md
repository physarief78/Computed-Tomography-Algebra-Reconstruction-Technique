# Computed-Tomography-Algebra-Reconstruction-Technique
Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an innovative imaging technique that directly detects superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) injected into the body.  MPI detects SPIONs by exploiting their unique magnetic properties that generate detecable signal. This enables real-time, high-sensitivity imaging of biological processes, making it a promising tool for various medical applications, including cancer detection, cardiovascular disease assessment, and cell tracking. However, in order to achieve this, we must reconstruct the detecable signal to high resolution information based on image. One of the most common and powerful technique for this is system matrix based approach. However, if the distribution of SPIONs in body is complex, this approach will give us a real headache. Therefore, there is a reconstruction technique called Algebra Reconstruction Technique (ART). This reconstruction is an iterative algorithm used to reconstruct images from a series of projections. This can be perfomed by implemented the Field Free Line (FFL) to scan the SPIONs that distributed in body. In this repository, i performed the ART from scratch using C++ code and visualize the results using Python. This was done in order to understand how ART works and it can be done in MPI such as in MRI
